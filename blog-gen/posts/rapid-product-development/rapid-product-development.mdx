Over the last 30 years a lot has changed about digital product development. Products that took years to build in 1990 could be built today in hours. Different, modular components of software applications have become free and open source— operating systems, web servers and even application interfaces themselves. As this occurred not only did the amount of custom code needed greatly decrease, but the type of coding also changed. Today we are entering a very exciting era. Today, most products can be built by very junior engineers and many products don’t require code at all [^1]. I feel strongly that this will lead to 

1\. An explosion of successful, small startups, especially in markets where it’s difficult to find experienced engineers.  
2\. A huge number of new roles for junior engineers and medium skilled technical workers.  
3\. A large opportunity for products and services serving the above groups.  

I want to be part of this. I want to help companies adopt these modern product development methods so they can move faster and cheaper, hire a more diverse team and ultimately build better products.

To see why now is such a pivotal time, it’s important to thinkg about how we got here. This isn’t the first time this type of shift has happened. Over the last 30 years we’ve seen 3 distinct epochs of software development defined by what components of an application needed to be custom built. 

Any application can be thought of as having 3 differentiating components: **Configuration, Logic and Data**. A helpful analogy for when thinking about software this way is a house. 

If an application was a house **configuration** would describe the existence and features of everything in the house. The furniture, doors, appliances, etc. 

**Logic** would describe how the humans in the house interact with everything in the house. This would include rules like “if a guest comes to the house open the door and get them a glass of water” or “if a robber comes to the house lock the door and call the police”.

**Data** is not anything physical in the house, but rather the state of the house at a given time. It is the location of each appliance and item. It changes as a result of humans moving things around as they follow logical rules. The data for the house will be different before and after a party. 

In the early days of computers all three of the above components had to be created for each application. A developer needed to define what a button, box, or form was themselves. This was like building a house and furniture on your own.

By 2009 developers no longer needed to write code for configuration. Standard components existed for most things. Developers favored “convention over configuration” and spent most of their time writing logic. This was like buying a furnished apartment. You still needed to move items around yourself for cooking, working, etc, but you didn’t need to create those items yourself.

Today developers don’t need to write logic or configuration. With tech like React and Firebase developers can simply define the state of an application, and the application will respond accordingly. This is like having a mansion with servants. When you want to have a party you don’t need to move any furniture yourself, you simply tell the servants “party mode please”, and a few minutes later the dance floor is out. The servants know what the configuration “party mode” means and they know what logical behaviors will get the house into that state. You simply give them data, aka the words “party mode”, and your house changes into that new state. The hard part of throwing excellent parties becomes knowing the possible states your house can be in and describing those states to your servants. 

With each new epoch mentioned above we’ve seen drastic shifts in who builds products, what products are built and how they are made.

In the age of configuration software development was a dark art, mastered by “wizards”, over many years. They used esoteric commands and simple text editors to build apps with small amounts of logic. Think Pong.

In the age of logic we saw the explosion of Coding Bootcamps. Suddenly anyone who could grasp computing logic could build a website. They used this logic to string together open source libraries into a complex apps like Facebook, with many different pages and features.

Today, if you can use a spreadsheet, you can build an app. Zapier let’s you move data in and out of existing applications and Airtable let’s you modify and display that data. You can even find entire interfaces which just need a data source to come to life. Modern apps aren’t differentiated by logic or configuration, they are competitive because of their data. Hundreds of competitors to Facebook have come and gone, many with better interfaces or features. Facebook still wins because of its user data.

Today’s ideal startup employee is no longer the hacker or the ambitious coding bootcamp grad. It’s someone who can find and combine existing tools and libraries with minimal code. It’s someone who understands how to collect, process and organize data, perhaps using fancy things like machine learning. It’s someone who thinks about products as ways to collect, display and process data, not logical systems. 

This isn’t a skillset most engineers have. This also, interestingly, isn’t a skillset most data scientists have. I believe these skills belong to a new role which I’m calling “Rapid Product Developer”. I’ve developed these skills over the last few years launching products on my own and as Director of Product at Andela. Now I want to help others do the same!
