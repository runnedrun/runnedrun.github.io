Our current “information age” is thus named because of the vast amount of information that is now cheaply and easily accessed. Whether it’s about weather, friends or cats, more information than ever before is now available to the average consumer.

Throughout this age we, Software Engineers, have always been gatekeepers. Consumers have relied on us to conjure up information, stored digitally as data, using the magic of code. That however, is changing.

The challenge of coding, and thus the exclusivity of the Software Engineering field, has historically been due to the need to understand computing _logic._ Over the past 40 years, however, the field has gotten progressively easier to enter as logic became modularized. 40 years ago if you wanted to draw a square on the screen you needed to write a hundred lines of code. Eventually though, someone took all that logic and put it in a module so that today you can just write drawSquare(). 

At first this process was slow. Engineers could only learn so many modules so only the most common features were modularized. However, in 2008, things changed. Improvements in search engines and the launch of Stack Overflow and Github made it easy to share and find modularized code. For the experts who had already mastered the logic needed for their domain, it seemed like only a small improvement. However, over the next few years it enabled a true disruption of the industry. It became possible for anyone to become a generalist software engineer with just a few months of training in computing logic and the ability to Google modules for everything else. If you were cooking dinner instead of making an app, this would be like going from grinding your own flour to picking up ingredients at the store.

Today, I propose that we’re on the cusp of another disruption. There is now a popular module for almost every feature. Historically logic heavy functions like data management and UI rendering have been replaced by simple modules like Firebase or React. Today, you can build many apps with no logic at all. Back to the dinner analogy— today, you don’t need to cook at all to make dinner, you can simply buy a meal at the hot foods counter. 

Similar to 2008 this change is only an incremental improvement for existing engineers. I recently pitched Firebase to an engineering team and they pointed out that the logic it removed was easy for them. To them, it wasn’t worth learning a new system to remove a couple hundred lines of easy code. However, that logic is not easy to a junior engineer or, obviously, a non-engineer. This shift to logic-less programming is unlocking product development in the same way Airbnb unlocked the guesthouse industry. It’s making it easy for almost anyone to do the things that only experts could do before. 

This doesn’t mean product development has become easy— the challenges have just changed. To build products without logic you still need to understand data modeling, UI design and systems architecture. What will help the next generation of product builders and companies master these skills?

The harbingers of the last disruption in product development, in 2008, were dev shops and bootcamps. Dev Shops like Pivotal Labs brought the new, generalist, methodology to startups and enterprises, building tools for this new type of engineer along the way. Bootcamps trained new developers that these transformed companies could then hire. 

Today, there are similar opportunities. [80/20](https://www.8020.inc/) and [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/startups) are consultancies specializing in logic-less product development and training. [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/) and [Boundless](https://www.boundlesslabs.com/) are no-code tools. All of these launched in the last year. 

I’m throwing my hat into this very exciting ring. I directed training at one of the world’s top dev shops, engineered high scale systems at Twitter and hacked together profitable products to launch two startups.  All this has left me with a lot of excitement about removing barriers to product development and a unique perspective on how it can be done. I’ll write about this perspective in more detail in upcoming posts, but for now, I can say that I’m starting with a consultancy: Logicless Labs. We’re helping startups build products faster, without engineers. If you have a product to build but are struggling to hire engineers, reach out!

If you vehemently disagree with my ideas, definitely reach out— would love to hear your feedback.
